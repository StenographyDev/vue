# VueJS as explained by Stenography

I think this was an interesting case for Stenography for a few reasons:

- VueJS is a very popular open source repo
- Its long (there are A LOT of files), includes a lot of confusing code
- Not many answers would be found on a site like Stack Overflow, since Vue contributors likely have their own approval process and small community in which they speak
- [Vue has a great documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrxmtDw4pVI&ab_channel=Honeypot)
